## Mini Project 3: 
## Demonstration of POPPY python package

### What is POPPY?

POPPY (Physical Optics Propagation in PYthon) is a python package that can be used to simulate light propagtion. POPPY is primarily designed for astronomical telescope applications but can be used for more imaging applications. Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction can be modeled in this package.

### What is the appeal of POPPY?

Most software used for optical modeling and light propagation is very expensive and so there is limited access to this software. POPPY is free open source software that has been consistantly updated (last update in Nov. 2019) and was designed for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) so it has been tested and used to design expensive equipment.
