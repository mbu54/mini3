## Mini Project 3: Demonstration of POPPY python package

I collabroated with Jenny Campbell on the demostration of POPPY with approval from Prof. Osama

### What is POPPY?

POPPY (Physical Optics Propagation in PYthon) is a python package that can be used to simulate light propagtion. POPPY is primarily designed for astronomical telescope applications but can be used for more imaging applications. Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction can be modeled in this package.

### What is the appeal of POPPY?

Most software used for optical modeling and light propagation is very expensive and so there is limited access to this software. POPPY is free open source software that has been consistently updated (last update in Nov. 2019) and was designed for the NASA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) so it has been used for simulations to design real telescopes. POPPY must must be a robust python package to use for designing something as expensive as a telescope. 

### What are the problems with POPPY?

POPPY is very coputational heavey like most imaging software. When trying to the run the package on my computer it would crash because I didn't have enough memory. When working with Jenny we were able to get POPPY to run computation on her computer.
